WELCOME TO THE ALPHA VERSION 0.01a OF RATHMOURNE UI.

TO USE THE TOOL: UNZIP THE ZIPPED FOLDER TO YOUR DESIRED DIRECTORY AND RUN RathmourneUI.EXE. PLEASE KEEP ALL FILES TOGETHER.

RATHMOURNE UI TOOL IS GAME AGNOSTIC, DOES NOT DEPEND ON GAME DATA NOR WILL IT SCRAPE MEMORY FOR ANY GAME DATA.
THE TOOL ALSO CANNOT PERFORM ANY ACTIONS FOR THE USER IN ANY GAMES, CANNOT BE USED AS AN AUTOMATION TOOL.

THE RATHMOURNE TOOL CAN ONLY BE USED ON WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS, TESTED ON WINDOWS 11 AND WINDOWS 10.

THIS TEST BUILD IS FOR DIABLO 4. SOME FUNCTIONS THAT ARE INTENDED TO WORK OUTSIDE OF DIABLO 4 MAY NOT WORK.

RATHMOURNE UI MAY NEED TO BE RAN IN ADMIN MODE OR ELEVATED MODE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.

THIS BUILD CONTAINS TWO MAIN COMPONENTS AND ONE SUBCOMPONENT.

ABILITY - THIS COMPONENT IS AN ABSTRACT COMPONENT, IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING BY ITSELF. IT HAS POWERFUL SUBCOMPONENTS, SUCH AS IMAGE REPLICATION.

IMAGE REPLICATION COMPONENT - ALLOWS THE USER TO SPECIFY A PIXEL AREA ON THEIR MONITOR AND REPLICATE IT ONTO ANOTHER PART OF THE SCREEN. YOU CAN CONTROL THE INPUT SIZE, OUTPUT SIZE, AND ALPHA.

ABILITY FORMATTER COMPONENT - WILL ALLOW MULTIPLE IMAGE REPLICATION COMPONENTS TO BE PROPERLY ALIGNED AND FORMATTED TO THE USER'S LIKING. THE FORMATTER WILL OVERRIDE OUTGOING SIZE AND ALPHA OF IMAGE REPLICATORS.

RATHMOURNE HAS A BASIC SAVE SYSTEM WHICH WILL BE OVERHAULED INTO A MULTIPLE PROFILE SAVE SYSTEM IN THE FUTURE. SAVING OCCURS WHEN EXITING EDIT MODE AND EXITING THE APPLICATION.

HERE ARE USEFUL HOTKEYS:

CTRL-ALT-J: TOGGLE EDIT MODE ON AND OFF.

WHILE IN EDIT MODE:
- RIGHT-CLICK TO SELECT COMPONENTS.
- IF A FORMATTER IS SELECTED, YOU MAY SHIFT-LEFT-CLICK IMAGE REPLICATORS TO ADD THEM TO THE FORMATTER, OR SHIFT-LEFT-CLICK IMAGE REPLICATORS ALREADY ADDED TO THE FORMATTER TO REMOVE THEM.

EDIT MODE WILL ALLOW YOU TO MOVE COMPONENTS WITH LEFT-CLICK AND DRAG. COMPONENT PROPERTIES CAN BE MODIFIED OUTSIDE OF EDIT MODE VIA THE MAIN MENU UI.
